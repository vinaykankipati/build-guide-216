Set up the Ubuntu host computer
-------------------------------

Install and configure the required software tools on the Ubuntu host computer.

1. Install the following packages to prepare your host environment for the Yocto build:

   .. container:: nohighlight
      
      ::

         sudo apt update
         sudo apt install build-essential chrpath cpio debianutils diffstat file gawk gcc git iputils-ping libacl1 locales python3 python3-git python3-jinja2 python3-pexpect python3-pip python3-subunit socat texinfo unzip wget xz-utils zstd
         sudo apt install pipx

         # This command should add the kas binary location to your PATH.
         # Restart your shell session after running this command for the changes to take effect.
         pipx ensurepath

         # The kas version is expected to be 4.8 or higher
         pipx install kas

#. (Optional) Download the ``kas-container`` script.
   The ``kas`` package includes this script to run **kas** inside a container.  
   If you prefer to build images in an isolated environment, use ``kas-container``.

   .. container:: nohighlight
      
      ::

         # kas-container can be run on any Linux distribution with Docker installed.
         wget -qO kas-container https://raw.githubusercontent.com/siemens/kas/refs/tags/5.1/kas-container
         chmod +x kas-container

.. note::
  The `kas <https://kas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__ tool is used by Qualcomm Linux to sync the meta layers, configure the environment, and execute the bitbake commands.

Sync
-----

QLI uses the kas tool to sync and build the Yocto meta layers. For every critical release, Kas lock files record the meta-layer repository information in `meta-qcom-releases <https://github.com/qualcomm-linux/meta-qcom-releases>`__.

You can checkout the lock files for each release using the `meta-qcom-release-tag`. The meta-qcom release tag follows the syntax ``qli-<version>``. For example, the meta-qcom release tag can be ``qli-2.0-rc1``, where ``2.0-rc1`` is the release version.

Build a BSP image
-----------------

Create and build a Yocto image:

1. Download Qualcomm Yocto and the supporting meta layers. For the latest ``<meta-qcom-release-tag>``, see the section *Build-Critical Release Tags* in the `Release Notes <https://docs.qualcomm.com/doc/80-80020-300/>`__.
      
   .. container:: nohighlight

      ::

         git clone https://github.com/qualcomm-linux/meta-qcom-releases -b <meta-qcom-release-tag>
         kas checkout meta-qcom-releases/lock.yml

#. Copy the kas lock file from ``meta-qcom-releases`` to ``meta-qcom``.  
   Run this step, or the checked‑out meta layers may update to a newer commit.

   .. container:: nohighlight
      
      ::

         # kas configuration files must be a part of the same repository
         # copy kas lock file to meta-qcom repository
         cp meta-qcom-releases/lock.yml meta-qcom/ci/lock.yml

#. Build the software image.
   You define build targets based on machine and distribution combinations.

   .. container:: nohighlight
      
      ::

         kas build meta-qcom/ci/<machine.yml>:meta-qcom/ci/<distro.yml>:meta-qcom/ci/linux-qcom-6.18.yml:meta-qcom/ci/lock.yml

         # Example, kas build meta-qcom/ci/qcs9100-ride-sx.yml:meta-qcom/ci/qcom-distro-prop-image.yml:meta-qcom/ci/linux-qcom-6.18.yml:meta-qcom/ci/lock.yml

   For various ``<machine>`` and ``<distro>`` combinations, see `Release Notes <https://docs.qualcomm.com/doc/80-80020-300/>`__.

   .. note:: You can build the images in a fully isolated environment by using `kas-container <https://kas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/userguide/kas-container.html>`__.

#. After a successful build, check if the ``rootfs.img`` file exists in the build artifacts.

   .. container:: nohighlight

      ::

         # meta-qcom uses qcomflash IMAGE_FSTYPE to create a single tarball
         # containing all the relevant files to perform a full clean flash,
         # including partition metadata, boot firmware, ESP # partition and
         # the rootfs.
         cd <workspace-dir>/build/tmp/deploy/images/<MACHINE>/<IMAGE>-<MACHINE>.rootfs.qcomflash/
         ls -al rootfs.img

.. note::
   * The machine configurations have either UFS or EMMC storage enabled by default. To change the default storage, see :ref:`Set storage <set_storage>`.
   * To build meta-qcom tip, see :ref:`Build meta-qcom tip <build_tip>`.
   * For repo manifest based builds, see :ref:`Alternative build instructions using Manifest <build_manifest>`.
